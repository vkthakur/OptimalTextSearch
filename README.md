# Text-_Search

An algorithm to extract some set of random words from a given dictionary such that the letter count requirement 
of user is fulfilled. e.g. given that the user requires certain 'x' number of A's, y number of B's , z 
number of C's and so on using trie data structure.Also a comparison on the basis of time consumption between
naive algorithm and the algorithm using tries. For this application Qt platform is used.
